<h1>The Data Commons Project</h1>
<h2>2009</h2>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>

During 2010, the Data Commons Project under the auspices of the
Cooperative Development Institute was supported by a grant of $3500 from
Equal Exchange, and donations from the public.

</p>

<p>
The goal of the Data Commons Project is to develop and maintain an
accurate, comprehensive, public database of cooperative economic
initiatives.  We believe this could help achieve the vision of Equal
Exchange's worker-owners of &ldquo;A vibrant mutually cooperative community
of two million committed participants trading fairly one billion
dollars a year in a way that transforms the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>

During 2010, DCP developers did the following:

</p>

<ul>

  <li>Released all DCP software public and under an OSI-approved license.</li>
  
  <li>Collaborated in a code sprint to improve an online directory.</li>

  <li>Investigated data licensing and privacy issues.</li>

  <li>Investigated database issues.</li>

  <li>Contributed some fixes for software used in the course of their
  work back to their creators: specifically Gnumeric and Sqlite.</li>.
  
</ul>

<p>

Our policy was for all development to be done by committed members of
the DCP, without outsourcing.  Developers were free to invoice at a
fixed rate, and were encouraged to exercise their discretion about
whether they needed to invoice in order to justify getting DCP work
onto their calendar.

</p>


<h2>Free and open software</h2>

<p>

For the DCP to succeed, we will need a lot of partners to trust us and
collaborate with us.  As one step towards earning that trust, we have
decided to make our software and our software development process
public.

</p>

<p>

On May 4, 2009, DCP software development was migrated to a public
site:

</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://launchpad.net/datacommons">http://launchpad.net/datacommons</a>
</blockquote>

<p>

This site was key to the operation of a code sprint in October
2009.  All DCP code is released under an OSI-approved license,
making it free and open source.

</p>


<h2>Online directory</h2>

<p> The DCP has for several years maintained a public index of
cooperative-spirited organizations at find.coop.  A partial rewrite of
this site was developed at a code sprint held in Brattleboro in March
2007, but was never completed.  During 2009
the &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for this site was publically released on
launchpad, a well-respected site for software collaboration.  This
code was further improved during a code sprint in October 2009.  A
live test site (with minimal data) can be seen at: <p>

<blockquote>
     <a href="http://proto.find.coop">http://proto.find.coop</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
The new code is much sounder and easier to maintain.  It also
offers some new features:
</p>

<h3>Neighborhood mapping</h3>

This was a popular feature on find.coop: the ability to visualize
cooperative organizations that neighbor each other.  This was 
ported to proto.find.coop and improved to be more maintainable 
and scalable.

<h3>Cooperative-minded mapping</h3>

<p>
find.coop currently shows maps of organization locations using the
Google Maps viewer and data.  The Google Maps service is of excellent
quality, but we realized that the proprietary nature of the viewer and
data was distasteful to some of the community we wished to serve.
</p>

<p>
Therefore for proto.find.coop, we have instead used free and open
alternatives to the Google Maps viewer and data -- "openlayers" and
"openstreetmap" respectively.  We make it easy for users to switch
to Google Maps if that is their preference, but we don't make that
choice for them.
</p>

<h3>Machine tagging</h3>

<p>
An experimental branch has implemented custom fields for organizations
in a systematic way using a method called "machine tags" or "triple
tag".  This is intended to allow fields defined by different
authorities that might not quite coincide to coexist in the directory
(although a long term goal of the project would be reconciliation).
There is no consensus among DCP members about whether this approach is
the right one is not, and so it is maintained separately.
</p>

<h3>Bulk download</h3>

<p>
In proto.find.coop, it is much easier to download the results of a
search as a spreadsheet.  Both search results and individual listings
are available for download in structured formats (currently CSV and
XML).
</p>

<h2>Data licensing and privacy</h2>

<p>

Just like the DCP software is free and open, we would like to make
databases of cooperative initiatives free and open.  As for software,
it is possible to make creative use of existing laws to preserve
the freedom of data.

</p>

<p>

The first ever open data license was released in 2008 by a project run
by the Open Knowledge Foundation (called, coincidentally,
the "Open Data Commons").  During 2009, they released an Open Database
License that is close to what the DCP needs:

</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/">http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>

Further drafting efforts are in the works.  Given the limiting funding
of the DCP, we are happy to see a complementary project dealing with
the legal issues involved in licensing data correctly.

</p>


<p>

Privacy is another matter.  We are learning that many groups
are initially enthusiastic about making their data open, but
then balk as the implications sink in.  One common problem is
that for any data related to people, organizations quite
rightly want to protect their members from having their
data used in ways they haven't expressly allowed.

<h2>Contributed fixes</h2>

<h3>Gnumeric</h3>

<p>

Gnumeric is a free and open spreadsheet program that is an alternative
to Excel.  In the course of evaluating Gnumeric for its utility in
importing and exporting user data in bulk from spreadsheets, a DCP
developer improved the codebase.  The improvement was submitted
&ldquo;upstream&rdquo; to the Gnumeric team on May 6, 2009, and was
accepted in modified form.

</p>

<blockquote>
  <a href='https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=581616'>https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=581616</a><br />
  <a href='http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/announcements/1.9/gnumeric-1.9.8.shtml'>http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/announcements/1.9/gnumeric-1.9.8.shtml</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Gnumeric is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv2),
  one of the first licenses to use copyright law creatively in order
  to preserve the freedom of users rather than to limit them (an
  approach now called "copyleft").
</p>

<h3>Sqlite</h3>

<p>
Sqlite is a public domain database that is probably
the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world (it is 
embedded in firefox, skype, and many cellphones, for example).
In the course of evaluating Sqlite for its utility in
importing and exporting user data in bulk from databases, a DCP
developer fixed a flaw in round-tripping strings containing
numbers with leading zeros (for example, certain zip codes).  
The improvement was submitted
&ldquo;upstream&rdquo; to the Sqlite team on June 11, 2009, and was
accepted in modified form.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <a href='http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3906'>http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3906</a><br />
  <a href='http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7b61b6c6ce'>http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7b61b6c6ce</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The Sqlite codebase has been dedicated to the public domain by all
  its contributors, and so can be used without a license.  Rather
  subversively, in the place where source code would usually 
  contain licensing information, the Sqlite authors instead 
  have the following blessing:
</p>

<pre>
    May you do good and not evil
    May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others
    May you share freely, never taking more than you give.
</pre>

<h3>Advocacy</h3>

<p>

The DCP acted as a voice for the free and open source approach,
convincing at least one peer project to switch from
mandating a closed technologyto requiring an open one.
